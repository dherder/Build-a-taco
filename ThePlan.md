# Sales Engineering Fundamentals Checklist


## First 7 days -- Orient and Get your bearings

- [ ] Complete General Company Onboarding Checklists
- [ ] Establish weekly or biweekly 1:1 meetings with those people that are key to success in your role (Product, Sales Leadership, Engineering, CS)


## First 30 days -- Assess and Absorb Info

- [ ] Being new to the company, you have fresh eyes. Document everything that seems odd to you (Process, Product). 
- [ ] Begin working on domain knowledge acquisition. Complete guides found at https://fleetdm.com/guides.
- [ ] Act like a prospect. Sign up for a Cloud Trial. What makes sense? What doesn't? Document. 
- [ ] Understand Value Drivers. Why do freemium users convert to paid customers?
- [ ] Get involved in the community.
- [ ] Get Trained on Demo2Win


## First 60 days -- Synthesize

- [ ] Build out the Technical Success Criteria document to be used in Enterprise Workshops / PoCs. Sample Success Criteria doc: 
- [ ] Take what you've learned in Demo2Win training and build out some killer enterprise demo workflows
- [ ] Use Storylane.io (or similar) to produce easily consumable tidbits of trackable (technical) demo material


## First 90 days + -- Contribute

- [ ] Build and Maintain Account Planning from a Technical perspective. What does Presales handoff to CS look like? Were prospect use cases documented? 
- [ ] Sample Account Plan: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AEa16lmfl-S2Acc-xxCadYYCtnch3maaj0T2ESl_yOQ/edit?usp=sharing


## General Demo Environment

- [ ] Have a quiet place available
- [ ] Ensure you have a backup source of power. Not just your laptop battery.
- [ ] Multiple monitors are your friend.
- [ ] Demo from a clean "demo" user profile. Clear your desktop


## Avoid these demo sins
- [ ] Show absolutely everything the product does before you've done a technical discovery
- [ ] Arrive to the demo without a plan. Book a pre-call strategy meeting with your AE. Understand who you are presenting to. Look at some tips on walnut.io (https://www.walnut.io/post/7-sales-demo-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them)
- [ ] Conduct a product training
- [ ] Live Troubleshooting
