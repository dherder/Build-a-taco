## First 60 days -- Synthesize

- [ ] Use Storylane.io (or similar) to produce easily consumable tidbits of trackable (technical) demo material


## First 90 days + -- Contribute

- [ ] Build and Maintain Account Planning from a Technical perspective. What does Presales handoff to CS look like? Were prospect use cases documented?

- [ ] Expand Deployment Guides to include steps for GCP and Azure.


## General Demo Environment

- [ ] Have a quiet place available
- [ ] Ensure you have a backup source of power. Not just your laptop battery.
- [ ] Multiple monitors are your friend.
- [ ] Demo from a clean "demo" user profile. Clear your desktop
- [ ] Pause desktop notifications


## Avoid these demo sins
- [ ] Show absolutely everything the product does before you've done a technical discovery. Sometimes even a brief discovery prior to demo will hone your focus for the demo.
- [ ] Arrive to the demo without a plan. Book a pre-call strategy meeting with your AE. Understand who you are presenting to. Look at some tips on walnut.io (https://www.walnut.io/post/7-sales-demo-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them)
- [ ] Conduct a product training
- [ ] Live Troubleshooting
- [ ] Talk over your prospect.
